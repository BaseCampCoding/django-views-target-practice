# More View Practice

The goal of this assignment is to get more practice with views.

The assignment is based on the "basics" portion of Starting JS assignment.

You should write a url+view+template for each function in https://github.com/BaseCampCoding/starting-js/blob/master/basics.js.

The inputs to your views should be provided through `GET` parameters.

The outputs should be displayed to the user through the template.

`add` has been done for you as an example.
